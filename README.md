1\. Project Overview and Goals
------------------------------

Fitz is a fictional app created for a group project for the course HCI 430: Prototyping and Implementation at DePaul University. The aim of this app was to help people shop online quickly and easily through a personalized experience.

Our goal was to create an applications that utilizes two channels, Desktop/mobile, that allows its users to purchase clothes regardless of their body shapes, where clothe selection is highly personalized to your body type with the aid of current technological advancements, such as by performing a 3D scan of your body in order to get clothes suggestions tailored for you, and in doing so, greatly simplifying the clothes selection process and diminishing well-fitment frustrations.

3\. Digital Narrative
---------------------

### Personas

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78060658/176204765-ace64312-2201-4ff1-b602-eb2d9bf1209d.png)

**Name:** Juan 

**Age:** 24 

**User Type:** Non-frequent Shopper

**Body Type:** short and thin 

**Goals:** Would like to find clothes that make him feel like he is in the “Now” without having to research what styles are trending. 

**Frustrations:** There are countless amounts for websites and stores to buy clothes from, and a plethora of clothes styles, but after wearing outfits that look great on models, he has found that it does not always translate to how he looks in real life. Feels frustrated at the idea that there are almost limitless amounts of styles and combinations to choose from, but that there is no personal guidance towards selection, and no way of figuring out what will best look on him without spending exorbitant amounts of time in the fitting room.

**Name:** Jerry 

**Age:** 36 

**User Type:** Frequent Shopper

**Body Type:** Heavyset

**Goals:** Find clothing that fits his body type which he finds is hard to shop for in stores.

**Frustrations:** Most of the time he finds that the shirts he likes do not fit him well. Limited stock and styles for the shirts that fit him well. Feels he wastes a lot of time in the dressing room searching for clothes that fit well. 

### Scenarios

**Scenario 1** 

A user is going to an event but doesn’t have any clothes to match the dress code. They don’t have enough time to go shopping in person, so they decide to use the app to easily find trendy clothes that fit their body type. While on the app, the user utilizes their phone’s 3D camera scan to create a virtual avatar of themselves. The avatar allows them to try on clothes virtually before buying and get recommendations that flatter their body. Once the clothes are purchased, the user can check back on the app for shipment details.  

**Scenario 2** 

A user is going to a party and does not know what to wear. He utilizes the mobile app where he has already signed up before, and previously taken a 3D avatar of his body type with his mobile phone’s camera to visualize outfits for the selected ‘Event Type’: ‘Party’. Then he selects tags or filters under the event type to describe the party type, terms such as “chill”, “backyard party”, “night”, “college” so that the app shows him styles based on Outfit Style Selection ‘Trendy’, ‘Hip’, ‘Classics’, etc. shaped by the atmosphere of the party as pinpointed by the ‘Party’ selected tags. The user then decides that he wants to be able to see the outfits in a bigger screen while lying down in bed, so he goes to his room from where he was sitting in the living room and continues visualizing outfits in his laptop’s 15-inch screen.

5\. Usability Testing
---------------------

The following usability testing was done on the Mid-Fi Prototype demonstrated above. Due to limited time, we were only able to get through one round of testing. Nonetheless, this testing provided us with great feedback and allowed us to make significant changes.

### Users

**User 1**

Name: Carlos 

Age: 28

Occupation: Mechanical Engineer

Gender: Male

User Type: Non-frequent shopper

**User 2**

Name: Gabriela 

Age: 21

Occupation: Medical Student

Gender: Female

User type: Frequent shopper

**User 3**

Name: Monica

Age: 25

Occupation: Child Life Specialist

Gender: Female

User type: Frequent Shopper

### Task Scenarios

Task Scenario #1

_“Imagine you are a frequent shopper_, _and you are attending a concert but have nothing to wear. You realize you don’t have time to go shopping in person so you browse through the FITZ_ **_app_** _to purchase a new outfit that is trendy. Using the FITZ app, can you show me how you would go to the category for trendy clothes? Can you show me how you can favorite an item for try-on?”_

Task Scenario #2

_“Great, we are now moving on to the second scenario. Imagine you are an infrequent shopper because you dislike shopping for clothes that never fit you properly. Your friend tells you about the FITZ site so you decide to give it a try. Using the FITZ website, can you show me how you create a new account? After you have hypothetically scanned yourself on the mobile app, can you show me, on the desktop website, how you would shop for outfits that are selected just for you?”_

Task Scenario #3

__“Thank you, now we will move on to the final scenario. Imagine you are invited to a wedding and between work and life, you are unable to buy attire that is appropriate for the event although the wedding will be held four days from now. You’ve never attended any wedding and are clueless as to what will be appropriate to wear for such an occasion, but you hear from a close friend that the FITZ website allows you to shop for clothes that are tailored for event types such as weddings and birthdays and many more. How would you go about finding clothes to wear for the wedding you will be attending by using the FITZ website? This task is considered complete once you have reached the results page for the wedding event type under the FITZ website.”__

### Problems Encountered

*   “Favorite” button’s function and accessibility was not made clear and it was made too small for mobile screen.
*   Initial starting screen was confusing as it only contained a login button for returning users.
*   Problematic glitching on mobile app prototype.
*   Distrust of body scanning functionality.
*   Lengthy sign-up process.
*   Smoother transition from desktop to mobile.

### Mid-Fi Design Changes

Based on the issues identified, we made the following changes to our prototypes:

*   Added labels to the different buttons on the mobile app so that user’s can know what they do.
*   A screen for looking at “favorite” items was included along with a pop up message that let users know the item was added (or removed) from their favorite list when the heart was tapped.
*   Added a “continue as guest” option for the website version to allow users to be able to browse through the site without having to create an account (later removed).
*   Included display pictures for the different event options under “shop-the-occassion” category in the mobile version. .
